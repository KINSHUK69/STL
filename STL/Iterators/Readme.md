# ITERATORS
Iterators are used to point at the memory addresses of STL containers.<br>
They are primarily used in sequence of numbers, characters etc.<br>
They reduce the complexity and execution time of program.

1. begin() :- This function is used to return the beginning position of the container.
2. end() :- This function is used to return the after end position of the container.
3. advance() :- This function is used to increment the iterator position till the<br> specified number mentioned in its arguments.
4. next() :- This function returns the new iterator that the iterator would point after advancing the positions mentioned in its arguments.
5. prev() :- This function returns the new iterator that the iterator would point after decrementing the positions mentioned in its arguments.
